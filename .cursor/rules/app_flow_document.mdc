# App Flow Document for Global2India Website

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user visits the Global2India website, they are greeted by a modern and inviting landing page that introduces the company’s mission of providing reliable forwarding services from international locations to India. This landing page hosts an eye-catching hero section with a welcoming banner and strategic call-to-action buttons such as “Request a Quote.” For users who wish to explore additional features like order tracking, the system offers an optional registration process. Users can create an account using their email or can use social login options, ensuring a simple sign-up experience. There is also a straightforward sign-in page where returning users can enter their credentials, and a help option for recovering lost passwords in case of any difficulties. Administrators access a dedicated login portal secured with OAuth2 or JWT authentication, which not only allows them to manage site data including pricing rates and customer inquiries but also to maintain AWB tracking updates through a secure admin panel.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon entering the website, most users experience the main dashboard or home page, which is designed to immediately convey the core message of Global2India. The home page features a visually striking hero section along with multiple banners that can include clickable links for promotions, news, or important announcements. The navigation bar is clearly displayed at the top with the company logo placed prominently on the left. Users can easily traverse through key sections such as Home, About Us, Services, Request a Quote, and Contact Us using the main menu. The home page offers clear calls to action that encourage engagement, whether to request a quote or to further explore the service offerings through detailed information on other parts of the site.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

In the user journey, the experience is designed to be seamless from the moment they land on the website. Starting at the home page, a visitor can continue to the About Us page, where they are provided with a succinct explanation of Global2India’s mission, core values, and vision. The narrative builds credibility and trust through clear and concise information about the company’s services. From there, the user can navigate to the Services page where each service is presented in a visually appealing card format. Each card, which represents offerings such as International Courier Services, Parcel Delivery, Medicine Delivery, Warehousing & Distribution, Baggage Services, and Cargo Services, contains an image or icon, a short description, and an accessible link for more detailed information. When a user opts to request a quote, they are taken to the Request a Quote page. This dedicated form collects essential details including the user’s name, email, phone number, HSN code, weight, origin and destination country and pincode. Once the weight is provided, a rate is auto-calculated using the base rate formula (weight multiplied by 500), while also allowing administrative overrides if required. For those wanting to track their orders, an order tracking feature is available either through a guest-based system or via an optional user account. Should the user decide to create an account, they can log in later to view their order history and real-time tracking updates using their unique Air Waybill number. If users need to get in touch with Global2India, the Contact Us page offers an informative contact form, an embedded Google Maps display to pinpoint the company’s office location, and quick access to social media links and customer service details. In addition, every page consistently incorporates a comprehensive footer that functions as a mini-navigation area with direct links to various sections such as About Us, Quick Links including service details, and Reach Us information which contains the contact details.

## Settings and Account Management

Users have the option to manage their personal information and preferences through a straightforward account settings area. This section allows users to update basic profile details such as name, email, and password, as well as to configure notification preferences. For customers who opt into maintaining an account for order tracking and history, the account management page provides easy access to previous inquiries, quote requests, and shipment status updates. There is also a dedicated area within the admin panel where administrative settings such as custom rate modifications, service data updates, and customer inquiry management can be handled. Once any adjustments are made, users can easily navigate back to the main dashboard or home page without disrupting the overall flow of the experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is prepared to gracefully handle error states and alternate user paths to ensure a smooth experience. If a user enters invalid data in forms, such as a mistake in the Request a Quote or Contact Us submissions, clear error messages appear near the problematic fields, offering guidance on how to correct the entry. In situations where the site loses connectivity, a friendly message explains the disruption and suggests checking the internet connection before attempting to reload the page. For users attempting to access restricted sections—such as the admin panel without proper credentials—a secure redirect to the sign-in page is provided along with a notification regarding the need for proper authentication. In every instance, fallback pages and error messages are designed to help users regain the normal flow of the site without confusion.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the very first visit to the Global2India website, users are met with a clear and professional landscape that immediately establishes trust and credibility. Beginning at an engaging home page filled with intuitive navigation, users can quickly delve into learning about the company on the About Us page, explore detailed service offerings through well-designed service cards, or request a personalized quote through an easy-to-use form. For those wishing to track their shipments, the order tracking feature—available both through a guest mode and an optional user account—ensures they have timely information on their package status. Additionally, the Contact Us page simplifies reaching out to the company for further inquiries or support. Administrators, on the other hand, have a secure and efficient backend portal to manage rates, update service details, and maintain AWB tracking. Overall, the application is designed to provide a seamless journey from first interaction to everyday usage, ensuring every click and interaction is clear, connected, and easy to follow.
